# Online-Learning-Platform-Analysis
This project, "Online Education Analytics: Driving Student Success &amp; Course Optimization," is a pure SQL project designed to analyze student engagement and course effectiveness within a online learning platform.

### ðŸš€ Project Overview ##
---
This project showcases a pure SQL solution for analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and gaining actionable insights within a hypothetical online learning platform. As data analysts, understanding student engagement, course effectiveness, and instructor performance is paramount for making informed business decisions. This repository provides a robust SQL database design, a rich dataset, and a suite of advanced queries to address critical analytical questions.
